# The-Modding-Tree Loader

This is a simple loader for TMT mods, simply access https://lordshinjo.github.io/tmt-loader/ and enter parameters to access a tree:

* User: The GitHub user owning the repository on which the mod is hosted.
* Repo: The name of the repository containing the mod (defaults to `The-Modding-Tree`).
* Branch: The Git branch on which the mod lives (defaults to `master`).
* Load only mod files: Attempt to load only `mod.js` and other mod files from the mod repository, loading all other files from https://github.com/Acamaeda/The-Modding-Tree instead. This will probably not work if the mod changed any technical files.
